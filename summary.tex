\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

An algorithm for the reconstruction of the mass $m_{\PHiggs\PHiggs}$ of the $\PHiggs$ boson pair 
in events in which the Higgs boson pair decays via $\PHiggs\PHiggs \to \Pgt\Pgt\Pgt\Pgt$
and the $\Pgt$ leptons subsequently decay into electrons, muons, or hadrons has been presented.
The resolution on $m_{\PHiggs\PHiggs}$ has been studied in simulated events 
and amounts to $22$, $7$, and $9\%$, relative to the true mass of the $\PHiggs$ boson pair,
for events containing resonances $\textrm{X}$ of mass $m_{\textrm{X}} = 300$, $500$, and $800$~\GeV, respectively.
The mass resolution for resonances of low mass, near the kinematic threshold $m_{\textrm{X}} \approx 2 \, m_{\PHiggs}$,
is limited by the fact that the algorithm chooses the wrong association of electrons, muons, and $\tauh$ 
to $\PHiggs$ boson pairs in $13\%$ of events.
The probability to choose a spurious pairing decreases for resonances of higher mass and becomes negligible for $m_{\textrm{X}} \gtrsim 500$~\GeV.
The optimization of the choice of the correct pairing for resonances of low mass is left to future studies.
We expect that our algorithm will be useful in searches for heavy resonances decaying to $\PHiggs$ boson pairs
at the LHC.
