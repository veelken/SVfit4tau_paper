\section{The algorithm}
\label{sec:algorithm}

The reconstruction of $m_{\PHiggs\PHiggs}$ is based on maximizing the likelihood function:
\begin{align}
&
\mathcal{P}(\bm{p}^{\vis(1)},\bm{p}^{\vis(2)},\bm{p}^{\vis(3)},\bm{p}^{\vis(4)};\pX^{\rec},\pY^{\rec}|m_{\textrm{X}})
= \frac{32\pi^{4}}{s} \, \int \, d\Phi_{n} \, \cdot \hspace{2cm} \nonumber \\
& \qquad \vert \BW^{(1)}_{\Pgt} \vert^{2} \cdot \vert \mathcal{M}^{(1)}_{\Pgt\to\cdots}(\bm{\hat{p}}) \vert^{2} 
 \cdot \vert \BW^{(2)}_{\Pgt} \vert^{2} \cdot \vert \mathcal{M}^{(2)}_{\Pgt\to\cdots}(\bm{\hat{p}}) \vert^{2}
 \cdot \vert \BW^{(3)}_{\Pgt} \vert^{2} \cdot \vert \mathcal{M}^{(3)}_{\Pgt\to\cdots}(\bm{\hat{p}}) \vert^{2}
 \cdot \vert \BW^{(4)}_{\Pgt} \vert^{2} \cdot \vert \mathcal{M}^{(4)}_{\Pgt\to\cdots}(\bm{\hat{p}}) \vert^{2} \cdot \nonumber \\
& \qquad W(\bm{p}^{\vis(1)}|\bm{\hat{p}}^{\vis(1)}) \, W(\bm{p}^{\vis(2)}|\bm{\hat{p}}^{\vis(2)}) \, W(\bm{p}^{\vis(3)}|\bm{\hat{p}}^{\vis(3)}) \, W(\bm{p}^{\vis(4)}|\bm{\hat{p}}^{\vis(4)}) 
 \, W_{\rec}( \pX^{\rec},\pY^{\rec} | \pXhat^{\rec},\pYhat^{\rec} ) \, .
\label{eq:likelihood_with_hadRecoil}
\end{align}
with respect to the parameter $m_{\textrm{X}}$, 
the mass of the heavy particle $\textrm{X}$ that decays into a pair of $\PHiggs$ bosons.
We refer to the electron, muon, or hadrons produced in each $\Pgt$ decay as the ``visible'' $\Pgt$ decay products.
Their momentum is denoted by the symbol $\bm{p}^{\vis(i)$ ($i = 1,\ldots,4$).
Bold letters represent vector quantities.
The symbol $d\Phi_{n} = \prod_{i}^{n} \,
\frac{d^{3}\bm{p}^{(i)}}{(2\pi)^{3} \, 2 E_{(i)}}$ denotes the differential $n$-particle phase space element,
where $n$ refers to the number of particles in the final state.
The symbol $\vert \BW^{(i)}_{\Pgt} \vert^{2} \cdot \vert \mathcal{M}^{(i)}_{\Pgt\to\cdots}(\bm{\hat{p}}) \vert^{2}$ 
denotes the squared modulus of the ME for the decay of the $i$-th $\Pgt$ lepton.
The symbols $W(\bm{p}^{\vis(i)}|\bm{\hat{p}}^{\vis(i)})$ and $W_{\rec}( \pX^{\rec},\pY^{\rec} | \pXhat^{\rec},\pYhat^{\rec} )$ are referred to as ``transfer functions'' (TF).
They quantify the experimental resolutions with which the momenta of particles reconstructed in the event are measured.
More specifically, the TF $W(\bm{p}|\bm{\hat{p}})$ represents the probability density to observe the measured momentum $\bm{p}$,
given that its the true value of the momentum is $\bm{\hat{p}}$.
The symbol $W(\bm{p}^{\vis(i)}|\bm{\hat{p}}^{\vis(i)})$ represents the resolutions for measuring the momenta of the visible $\Pgt$ decay products,
while the symbol $W_{\rec}( \pX^{\rec},\pY^{\rec} | \pXhat^{\rec},\pYhat^{\rec} )$ quantifies the resolution for measuring the momentum, in the transverse plane, of the hadronic recoil.
The hadronic recoil is defined as the vectorial sum of all particles in the event that do not originate from the decay of the two $\PHiggs$ bosons.
The components $\pX^{\rec}$ and $\pY^{\rec}$ of its momentum are related to the corresponding components $\METx$ and $\METy$ of the ``missing transverse momentum'',
the vectorial sum of the momenta of all neutrinos produced in the $\Pgt$ lepton decays, via the relations:
\begin{align}
\METx = & -( \pX^{\rec} + \pX^{\vis(1)} + \pX^{\vis(2)} + \pX^{\vis(3)} + \pX^{\vis(4)} ) \nonumber \\
\METy = & -( \pY^{\rec} + \pY^{\vis(1)} + \pY^{\vis(2)} + \pY^{\vis(3)} + \pY^{\vis(4)} ) \nonumber \, .
\end{align}

The number of particles in the final state, $n$, depends on how many $\Pgt$ leptons decay to electrons or muons 
and how many decay to hadrons.
Following the formalism developed in Ref.~\cite{SVfitMEM}, 
we treat hadronic $\Pgt$ decays as two-body decays into a hadronic system $\tauh$ and a $\Pnut$.
Correspondingly, $n$ increases by $2$ for each leptonic ($\Pgt \to \enunu$ or $\Pgt \to \mununu$) and by $3$ units for each hadronic ($\Pgt \to \textrm{hadrons} + \Pnut$) $\Pgt$ decay.
Particles that are part of the hadronic recoil do not contribute to the differential $n$-particle phase space element $d\Phi_{n}$.
The dimension of the integral over the differential $n$-particle phase space element $d\Phi_{n}$ thus
varies between $8$ for events that decay via $\PHiggs\PHiggs \to \Pgt\Pgt\Pgt\Pgt \to \tauh\tauh\tauh\tauh$ 
and $12$ for events that decay via $\PHiggs\PHiggs \to \Pgt\Pgt\Pgt\Pgt \to \Plepton\Plepton\Plepton\Plepton$,
where the symbol $\Plepton$ refers to either an electron or a muon.

The dimensionality of the integration over the $n$-particle phase space element $d\Phi_{n}$ 
can be reduced by means of analytic transformations. 
Two (three) variables are sufficient to fully parametrize the kinematics of hadronic (leptonic) $\Pgt$ decays.
We choose to parametrize hadronic $\Pgt$ decays by the variables $z$ and $\phi_{\inv}$,
and leptonic $\Pgt$ decays by the variables $z$, $\phi_{\inv}$, and $m_{\inv}$.
The variable $z$ corresponds to the fraction of $\Pgt$ lepton energy, in the laboratory frame, that is carried by the visible $\Pgt$ decay products.
The variable $\phi_{\inv}$ specifies the orientation of the $\bm{p}^{\inv}$ vector relative to the $\bm{p}^{\vis}$ vector,
where the vector $\bm{p}^{\vis}$ refers to the momentum of the visible $\Pgt$ decay products,
and we denote by the vector $\bm{p}^{\inv}$ the momentum of the $\Pnut$ (the vectorial sum of the momenta of the two neutrinos) produced in hadronic (leptonic) $\Pgt$ decays.
The variable $m_{\inv}$ denotes the mass of the neutrino pair produced in leptonic $\Pgt$ decays.
Expressions for the product of the differential $n$-particle phase space element $d\Phi_{n}$ 
with the squared moduli $\vert \BW^{(i)}_{\Pgt} \vert^{2} \cdot \vert \mathcal{M}^{(i)}_{\Pgt\to\cdots}(\bm{\hat{p}}) \vert^{2}$ 
of the ME for the $\Pgt$ decays that are obtained by these analytic transformations are given by Eq.~[33] in Ref.~\cite{SVfitMEM}.
The expressions read:
\begin{align}
\vert \BW_{\Pgt} \vert^{2} \cdot \vert \mathcal{M}^{(i)}_{\Pgt\to\cdots}(\bm{\tilde{p}}) \vert^{2} \, d\Phi^{(i)}_{\tauhnu} 
 = & \, \frac{\pi}{m_{\Pgt}\Gamma_{\Pgt}} \,
 f_{\Phadron}\left(\bm{\hat{p}}^{\vis(i)}, m^{\vis(i)},
   \bm{\hat{p}}^{\inv(i)}\right) \, \frac{d^{3}\bm{\hat{p}}^{\vis}}{2 \hat{E}_{\vis}} \, dz \, d\phi_{\inv} \nonumber \\
\vert \BW_{\Pgt} \vert^{2} \cdot \vert \mathcal{M}^{(i)}_{\Pgt\to\cdots}(\bm{\tilde{p}}) \vert^{2} \, d\Phi^{(i)}_{\ellnunu} 
 = & \, \frac{\pi}{m_{\Pgt}\Gamma_{\Pgt}} \, f_{\ell}\left(\bm{\hat{p}}^{\vis(i)},
 m^{\vis(i)}, \bm{\hat{p}}^{\inv(i)}\right) \, \frac{d^{3}\bm{\hat{p}}^{\vis}}{2 \hat{E}_{\vis}} \, dz \, dm^{2}_{\inv} \, d\phi_{\inv}
 \nonumber \, ,
\end{align}
where the functions $f_{\Phadron}$ and $f_{\ell}$ given by:
\begin{align}
f_{h}\left(\bm{p}^{\vis}, m_{\vis}, \bm{p}^{\inv}\right) = &
  \frac{\vert\mathcal{M}^{\eff}_{\Pgt \to \tauh\Pnut}\vert^{2}}{256\pi^{6}} \cdot \frac{E_{\vis}}{\vert\bm{p}^{\vis}\vert \, z^{2}} \nonumber \\
f_{\Plepton}\left(\bm{p}^{\vis}, m_{\vis}, \bm{p}^{\inv}\right) = &
  \frac{I_{\inv}}{512\pi^{6}} \cdot \frac{E_{\vis}}{\vert\bm{p}^{\vis}\vert \, z^{2}} \nonumber \, . 
\end{align}
